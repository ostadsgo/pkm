Here are the most useful Vim keys for folding and unfolding code:

## Basic Folding Commands

### Create Folds

- `zC` - Close all folds under cursor (recursively)
    
- `zf` - Create fold for visual selection
    
- `zf#j` - Create fold for # lines downward
    
- `zf/string` - Create fold until string pattern
    

### Open Folds

- `zo` - Open fold under cursor
    
- `zO` - Open all folds under cursor (recursively)
    
- `zr` - Reduce folding level (open more folds)
    
- `zR` - Open all folds in file
    

### Toggle Folds

- `za` - Toggle fold under cursor
    
- `zA` - Toggle fold recursively
    

### Navigation

- `zj` - Move to next fold
    
- `zk` - Move to previous fold
    
- `[z` - Move to start of open fold
    
- `]z` - Move to end of open fold
    

## Fold Methods

Set fold method with `:set foldmethod=`

- `manual` - Manual folds (created with zf)
    
- `indent` - Fold based on indentation
    
- `syntax` - Fold based on syntax
    
- `marker` - Fold based on markers in code
    

## Useful Settings

vim

" Enable folding
set foldenable
set foldlevelstart=99 " Start with all folds open
set foldnestmax=10    " Maximum nesting level

## Quick Tips

- `zm` - Increase foldlevel (close more folds)
    
- `zM` - Close all folds
    
- Use `:mkview` and `:loadview` to save/restore fold states
    
- `zd` - Delete fold under cursor
    
- `zE` - Eliminate all folds
    

These commands work across most file types and can significantly improve navigation in large files.
