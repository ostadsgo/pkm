Specifity is just a fancy word to css decloration precedence. like operator
precedence in math each style will apply based on specifity.
they call it specifity because the specific the style will have higher precedence.

style precedence from left to right.

inline, id, class | psudo class | attr selector, html_element


li.selected a[href]

inline id  class|.. html
0      0   2        2


#something.anoththing a#tag
inline id  class|.. html
0      2   1        1

the second decloration is more specific than first one. becuase id is more specific than class and elements.
